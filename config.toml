I am trying to let my career be led by this awareness, looking for the opportunity to test my capabilities and skills in challenging and rapidly evolving scenarios. I am conscious that I have to study, learn and experience so much before becoming the person I would like to be, but this does not scare me, quite the opposite, it is pushing me further to go beyond my limits."
